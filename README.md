# aggregated

Updated *R code* that implements the methods developed in the paper cited below and illustrates their use. It allows making valid inference for the disaggregated relationship between response and explanatory variables when using temporally aggregated response data and disaggregated explanatory variables.

The example code uses the functions in the file agr_functions_v6_cpp.r, which is sourced in example_code.r. The dataset contains daily mortality and temperature data from Paris.
